This script will create a canvas for you in Aseprite that is setup for creating art in a dot matrix display style.

What it does is creates a black 10x10 square brush, this is your new pixel size.

When you enter a canvas width and height, it multiplies the values by 11.
This gives you a canvas of the same size you desired, but with larger pixels.

For instance, a 16x16 image will go up to 176x176, but since your pixel is now 10x10, and you must leave a 1px
space between each larger pixel, you can still only fit 16 pixels in both canvases.

I hope this makes sense, and I hope this script helps you out!

I created it because I need to create many such screens as seen in my example, and I wanted a way to expedite
the process of creating and setting up canvases!

Enjoy!
